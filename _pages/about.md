<i>"My Heart is in the Work" - Andrew Carnegie</i>

<b>Looking for Summer Internship for <u>Summer 2023</u> in Computer Vision and Deep Learning, where I can contribute to solve challenging problems</b>

Here is my [Resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oQ3B6Lyxrn86uvEN8o9wYRfqhlymyC_Q/view?usp=share_link)

I'm Balaji Praneeth Boga, currently pursuing masters in Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, focussing on Robotics and Controls. I hail from Hyderabad, India and currently based out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I'm diving deep in the Computer Vision and Deep Learning space. I'm interested in Data Science, Deep Learning and Computer Vision. I firmly believe that my passion, hard work and leadership skills shall empower me to create a meaningful impact on humanity through technology.

During my undergraduate studies, I worked along with a team of peers on design of a soft-robotic end-effector using PLA and published an Australian Design Innovation Patent on the same. I worked under the guidance of Prof. Jayakrishna Kandasamy in the domain of Multi Criteria Decision Making focussing on evaluating various supply chains of e-commerce websites. 

I have an experience in developing computer vision projects and disease classification models at Carnegie Mellon University. My core skills include problem-solving, programming, data analysis, and data preprocessing. I have proficiency in Python, MATLAB, and C/C++, and I have used Python libraries such as Scikit, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Numpy, and Pandas. My projects involved optimizing deep learning models such as Pix2Pix, Diffusion, Neural Style Transfer, and Cycle GANs. I have experience in supervised learning, hyperparameter tuning, data preprocessing, and visualization. My expertise in Git and Google Cloud has helped me optimize model performance and collaborate with teams.
