Abstract
======

This paper proposes a hybrid framework for assessing the performance of supply chains based on critical key performance metrics (KPMs) in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The framework utilizes a combination of the Best-Worst Method (BWM) and Fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (Fuzzy TOPSIS) to measure the performance of the supply chains and identify the critical KPMs. The proposed framework is illustrated using real-time data from experts and a case study of e-commerce supply chains. The study finds that the rate of return on investment, flexibility of service systems to meet customer needs, and supplier lead time against industry norms are significantly weighed in assessing performance. Amazon and Flipkart are identified as standing out among other supply chains. The paper emphasizes the importance of measuring supply chain performance in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic and highlights the flexibility and effectiveness of the proposed framework in handling large data and uncertainty in human emotions.
