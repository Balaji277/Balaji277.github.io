Introduction
======

This paper proposes a hybrid framework for assessing the performance of supply chains based on critical key performance metrics (KPMs) in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The framework utilizes a combination of the Best-Worst Method (BWM) and Fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (Fuzzy TOPSIS) to measure the performance of the supply chains and identify the critical KPMs. The proposed framework is illustrated using real-time data from experts and a case study of e-commerce supply chains. The study finds that the rate of return on investment, flexibility of service systems to meet customer needs, and supplier lead time against industry norms are significantly weighed in assessing performance. Amazon and Flipkart are identified as standing out among other supply chains. The paper emphasizes the importance of measuring supply chain performance in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic and highlights the flexibility and effectiveness of the proposed framework in handling large data and uncertainty in human emotions.


Process
======

A real case of e-commerce is presented to illustrate the working of the proposed framework comprising a hybrid methodology of BWM and Fuzzy TOPSIS to measure the performance of the e-commerce supply chains by identifying the critical key performance metrics (KPMs) and measuring the performance of the considered supply chains against these.

Results
======

* The rate of return on investment, flexibility of service systems, and supplier lead time against industry norm are significant factors in the framework.<br />
* The weights assigned to these factors are 0.07764, 0.06863, and 0.0547, respectively.<br />
* Amazon and Flipkart are highlighted as supply chains that stand out among others in the study.<br />
* The closeness coefficients of Amazon and Flipkart are 0.945 and 0.516, respectively.<br />


Conclusion
======

The contemporary world has seen the drastic attack of COVID-19 on many firms worldwide, and hence measuring the performance of the supply chains has become necessary so as to understand the critical factors affecting performance, their relative importance and the firm's relative standings. There have been studies in the recent past where researchers worked on similar motives to generate a framework to measure performance of supply chains, but it is seen that the methodologies lack flexibility with respect to effectively handling large data, uncertainty in human emotions, consistency, etc. This is where the current study stands out in effectively measuring the performance of supply chains so as to aid many firms affected by the pandemic.
