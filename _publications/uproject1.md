Abstract
======

In this project, a sustainable and innovative three-wheeler vehicle was designed and simulated with features such as electric drive and air conditioning powered by both solar energy and battery. The use of sustainable materials such as fiberglass for the shell and low carbon steel for the chassis and AM60A aluminum alloy for the wheels was carefully selected. The project also involved computational fluid dynamics analysis to determine the coefficient of drag and tonnage requirement for the air conditioning system, as well as a comparison of different refrigerants, ultimately selecting R134a as the primary refrigerant for the air conditioning system. This project aimed to provide a safe and comfortable mode of transportation while reducing harmful emissions and promoting sustainable development.
