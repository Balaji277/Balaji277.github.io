Abstract
======

This project aimed to accurately predict medical conditions based on symptoms using machine learning techniques. The dataset consisted of 1024 patients with 133 symptoms and 42 diseases as labels. Various machine learning models were evaluated, and Random Forest Classifier was found to be the most accurate with an accuracy of 99%. Feature engineering and optimal hyperparameter tuning were used to improve the model and reduce the number of necessary features for disease prediction. The modified dataset was benchmarked against the same models, and Random Forest Classifier remained the best-performing model. The importance of understanding the dataset, evaluating it against various models, and using feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning to improve accuracy was highlighted. The use of Random Forest Classifier provides a promising solution for healthcare settings.
